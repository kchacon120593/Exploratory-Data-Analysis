# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
Bay Area Bike Sharing Trips using Python and Jupyter Notebooks


The individualized mobility projects, in this case bycicles, have been growing in the last 10 years, as an alternative and solution to traffic congestion 
and environmental pollution. As DeMaio (2020) points in his blog, the growth of this type of projects has gone from one every couple of weeks to one each day. 
Fact that denotes that bike-sharing is a low-cost alternative (compared to other models of transportation) and both the public and private sectors can have 
great benefits from its implementation.

For these reasons, the following notebook presents an Exploratory Data Analysis of the Bay Area from January 2019 to March 2019 as 
an introduction to the matter of bike-sharing and some interesting facts that the data analyzed denotes.
